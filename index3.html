        <h1 class="title">History of Soccer</h1>
        <p class="history1">During the 12th century, what you could call the “bare bones” of soccer was being played in the meadows of England. This early version was called ‘Folkball,’ and while it barely resembles the modern sport, as it involved punching the ball with your fist and violently tackling the opposing team, it did focus on kicking. But the game was far too violent.
            <br>
            <br>
            It wasn’t until the 1800s after the British government had banned it for centuries, that it was re-established as a winter sport with much safer rules. The game was played between English public schools like Eton, Winchester, and Charterhouse. The only problem was that each school had its own rules. Some allowed the limited carrying of the ball, like rugby, while others didn’t allow players to touch it.
            <br>
            <br>
            The different rules made it hard for schools to compete. That is until 1848 when the Cambridge Rules were adopted. These rules were the first set of widely accepted soccer laws, but they still didn’t specify whether the ball could be handled.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, in 1863 the first Football Association (FA) was formed in London to standardize all rules relating to soccer. That’s when soccer and rugby became two separate sports and touching the ball with your hands became illegal.</p>
        <h1 class="title">Early Professional Soccer</h1>
        <p class="history2">The Industrial Revolution changed the landscape of soccer. In addition to schoolboys, factory workers took up the sport and created labor-centered teams. Soccer became a social athletic activity that would be played after work.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the introduction of railroads, teams could now travel to one another and compete. This is how the earliest versions of soccer leagues were invented. It was during this time that teams started paying the best sportsmen to join their club and selling tickets to the star-player’s matches. These developments marked soccer’s transition from an amateur game to a professional sport.
            <br>
            <br>
            While all this was going on, Sheffield became the home of the first amateur soccer club. Wanting to stay active in the winter months, Sheffield’s cricket team organized friendly soccer ‘kickabouts.’ Eventually, the members created an official soccer team, and that’s how the oldest club, Sheffield FC, was established in 1857. They invented their own set of rules, but after years of tension with rival clubs and associations, Sheffield conceded and started to abide by the FA’s rules.
            <br>
            <br>
            Soccer was becoming increasingly popular all across England, with leading clubs beginning to play each other. Eventually, the English Football League was established in 1888. During this time, soccer also began to garner popularity in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. As of 1890, all four countries in the UK had their own domestic leagues and competed against each other.
