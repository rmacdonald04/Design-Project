            <p class="paragraphEquipment">When it comes to equipment for soccer, very little comes to mind. There is of course the ball and maybe the uniform but for me, I think the only important equipment are the cleats and shin guards. These two things have a very important role when it comes to playing the sport. Cleats have pegs on the bottom to help with control on the feild. They help you keep your balance and can help grip the grass in different environments like the rain. Shin guards are also very important because they are you're one form of safety. These guards help protect you're shins from opponents who may be trying to kick the ball.</p>
